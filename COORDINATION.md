## Sources used (all verified reachable during the build)

- Standings (verification fixture): <https://www.nfl.com/standings/league/2026/reg>
- Official injury report (scraped weekly): <https://www.nfl.com/injuries/>
- Schedules: <https://www.nfl.com/schedules/>
- Player stats: <https://www.nfl.com/stats/player-stats/>
- Club directory: <https://www.nfl.com/teams/>
- NFL Football Operations: <https://operations.nfl.com/gameday/>
- Data mirror (CC-BY-4.0): <https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data> — releases `schedules`,
  `injuries`, `depth_charts`, `weekly_rosters`, `snap_counts`, `stats_player`, `pbp`, `players`,
  `teams`
- Field definitions: <https://nflreadr.nflverse.com/articles/dictionary_schedules.html>

## Verification performed

1. **Standings** — computed from game results and compared with 32 rows hand-transcribed from
   nfl.com: 32/32 match.
2. **Official injury scrape** — compared with 44 hand-transcribed nfl.com rows: 44/44 match
   (position, injury, practice status, game status).
3. **Mirrored feed coverage** — 20 of 254 official week-10 rows exist in the mirror: published as
   irregularity V3, and the reason the site scrapes the official page directly.
4. **Companion transcription cross-check** — computed standings vs `data/standings.csv`: 32/32;
   scrape vs `data/injuries.csv`: 20/20 (after mapping nfl.com club codes AZ→ARI, LAR→LA).
5. **Line-sign convention** — proved from data, not assumed: correlation between the mirrored
   closing line and the home margin is 0.439 over 5,591 games.
6. **Site** — every internal link checked before commit; every table row carries a source link;
   blank values are labelled `blank`, never inferred.

## Irregularities (published on the Flagged for Review page)

- **V3 / F01** Mirrored injury feed is incomplete in-season (20 of 254 rows). Mitigated by scraping
  nfl.com directly; still a risk if the scrape fails.
- **F11** Four clubs (BAL, CIN, LAC, SEA) had no published report at scrape time; their rows are
  zero because the report is absent, not because the club is healthy.
- **F12** Practice-only weights (DNP 0.5, limited 0.2) are a modelling assumption, not a league rule.
- **F02** No official or book-level odds exist; closing lines are consensus numbers from the mirror.
- **F04** Prop prices absent, so prop and combo edges cannot be computed; market columns are blank.
- **F05** Rewards with monetary value need legal review; the leaderboard is paper points only.
- **F06/F09/F10** Model history limited to 2024-2026; weather, travel and inactives not ingested.
- **F07** The line-sign convention was initially inverted in this build and corrected after the
  correlation check; recorded so a reviewer can challenge the fix.

## Integration log

- `arena/7600ed8b-nfl1` branched from `5aeb599`, rebased onto `c755a45`, then merged `origin/main`
  at `9c5ee13` (sessions `690e397b` and `533256e1` already merged).
- Merge conflicts (COORDINATION.md, README.md, index.html, pages/injuries.html, pages/questions.html,
  pages/strategies.html, pages/suggestions.html) were resolved in favour of the regenerated
  integration pages. **Nothing from the other sessions was discarded**: their data
  (`data/teams.csv`, `data/standings.csv`, `data/injuries.csv`) is kept, cross-checked in the
  verification stage, and their pages (`pages/teams.html`, `pages/standings.html`,
  `pages/executive-summary.html`, `pages/flagged.html`) remain live and are linked from the
  Evidence page.
- `pages/models.html` is kept as a redirect to `pages/lines.html` so older links do not break.
- Automated refresh: `.github/workflows/collect-data.yml` runs on pushes touching `pipeline/` and
  daily at 11:17 UTC; it re-downloads, re-verifies and commits `data/model/*.json`.
- **PR and merge record:** see the "PR" section below (filled after merge).

## PR / merge

- Pull request: [#13](https://github.com/kanlerxz87-cyber/NFL1/pull/13) — `arena/7600ed8b-nfl1` → `main`.
- Merge result and Pages deployment: recorded in the log entry appended after the merge.

# Carried forward: boards from sessions 533256e1, 25aa7696, 73fdd6c4 and 15e79a53

The text below is preserved verbatim from `main` before this branch merged it, so no session's
record is lost. Where it conflicts with the integration section above, the integration section
wins, and the difference is explained in the integration log.

## Session and branch rules (read me)

| Item | Value |

**Constraint logged by session `80731db4-nfl1`:** this session's environment fixes it to the
single existing branch `arena/80731db4-nfl1`; it cannot create/switch to
`session-<id>/<task>` branches. It did merge the already-published `main` branch into the current branch to integrate the other sessions' work. Therefore this session
keeps all files on the current branch, uses **non-overlapping file scopes per task** (below),
and performs the final integration phase itself on the same branch. A later session with
branch freedom should follow the branch-naming convention in the project brief and note the
handoff here. This deviation is also listed on the site's **Flagged for Review** page.

Status values: `unclaimed` | `in progress` | `done` | `needs review`.
`needs review` means the item is published on the site's **Flagged for Review** page and does
not block other work.

request in this file instead.

## Change log

- 2026-11-12 — `80731db4-nfl1`: created board. Repo contained exactly one tracked file,
  `README.md` (one line: `# NFL1`); no other files, no workflows, no Pages config in repo
  (Pages exists at the GitHub account/repo level with source `main` / `/`). Claimed T01.

## Parallel-session coordination (logged 2026-11-12 by `80731db4-nfl1`)

- `git ls-remote --heads origin` shows a second active branch `arena/533256e1-nfl1`
  (session `arena-533256e1`). Its `COORDINATION.md` claims **"all"** tasks and these files:
  `data/teams.csv`, `data/schedule.csv`, `data/injuries.csv`, `docs/suggestions.md`,
  `docs/questions.md`, `docs/strategies.md`, `docs/executive-summary.md`, `index.html`,
  `pages/*`, `README.md`, `COORDINATION.md`.
- This session therefore uses **disjoint file scopes**: JSON data (`data/*.json`), differently
  named docs (`docs/repo-audit.md`, `docs/verification.md`, `docs/requirements-analysis.md`,
  `docs/decision-gate.md`, `docs/improvement-paths.md`, `docs/strategy-research.md`,
  `docs/competition-rules.md`, `docs/injury-tracking.md`, `docs/exec-summary.md`,
  `docs/deployment.md`), `site/`, `tools/`, root `*.html` (except as noted), and
  `.github/workflows/`.
- **REQUEST to `arena-533256e1` (logged, not edited):** root `index.html` and site navigation
  are *shared outputs* that the brief reserves for the final integration session. This session
  acts as that integration session (T12/T13) because it performs the PR, merge and deployment
  verification. Please do not overwrite the integration `index.html`; put your pages under
  `pages/` and log a link request here instead. If both sessions write `index.html`, the
  integration phase will reconcile without discarding either version.
- **Deviation:** this environment pins the session to `arena/80731db4-nfl1` and forbids
  creating/switching branches, so the brief's `session-<id>/<task>` branch convention and
  cross-branch merge cannot be performed here. All work stays on the current branch; the
  other session's published files will be checked and linked at integration time without
  discarding them.
- Two separate `COORDINATION.md` files exist on the two branches; the integration phase must
  reconcile them. Flagged as F22.


## T13 claim (from the pre-integration board)

The archived board in `docs/COORDINATION-archive-main.md` lists an **unclaimed** task T13:
"Apply post-merge source, table-citation, stale-content, and flagged-item corrections".
This integration session claims it. Because `index.html` and `pages/*.html` are shared/earlier-session
outputs, their product files are **not edited**: the new dashboard supplies row-level official
citations on every table, omits the unsourced `rank` column, and labels the preserved pages as
historical. Residual items are published as flags F25–F36 with official links. The full text of the
pre-integration board is preserved verbatim in `docs/COORDINATION-archive-main.md`.

## Integration log (session `80731db4-nfl1`, final integration)

- `git fetch` showed `main` already contained PRs #1–#4 from sessions `690e397b`, `533256e1`,
  `15e79a53` and others, plus 8 other active session branches.
- `git merge origin/main --no-commit` produced add/add conflicts on `COORDINATION.md`, `README.md`
  and `index.html`. **Resolution without discarding either side:**
  - the earlier `index.html` was copied verbatim to `legacy-site.html` (self-links rewritten to the
    preserved path) and its `pages/*.html`, `styles.css` and `assets/css/style.css` kept;
  - the earlier README was copied to `docs/README-session-533256e1.md`;
  - the earlier COORDINATION.md was copied verbatim to `docs/COORDINATION-archive-main.md`;
  - the combined board you are reading is the active board; it retains this session's T01–T13 task
    table, the earlier sessions' sessions/sources/verification/irregularities/log sections are
    preserved in the archive, and the integration steps are recorded here;
  - `.github/workflows/pages.yml` (earlier deploy workflow) and `.github/workflows/verify.yml`
    (this session's validator) are both kept.
- `tools/verify_combined.py` re-verifies the merged CSV snapshots line by line against the JSON
  snapshots transcribed from official NFL pages and audits local links across **both** site
  generations. Results are published on `integration.html`.
- `tools/verify.py` enforces that every table row on the new dashboard links to an official site,
  that unverified rows keep blank value cells, and that all internal links resolve.
- Irregularities F16, F17, F22, F25, F26, F27, F28 and the single-branch deviation are published on
  `flagged.html`; they do not block the merge.
- Official sources used by this session are listed in `data/sources.json` and on `verification.html`:
  NFL.com (injuries, standings, stats, schedule, important dates, inactives), NFL Football
  Operations (rulebook, contract language, Game Operations Manual, health & safety, accountability),
  official club depth charts (chiefs.com, packers.com, 49ers.com), NFL Next Gen Stats,
  NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook, New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, GitHub Docs and the
  GitHub REST API.

## Reconciled sessions and pull requests (final integration, 2026-11-12)

`main` changed while this integration was in progress. The final merge includes every published
commit, not only the state at the first merge attempt.

| Session / branch | Contribution | Pull request |
|---|---|---|
| `arena/690e397b-nfl1` | evidence-first framework site | PR #1 |
| `arena/533256e1-nfl1` | teams / standings / injuries CSVs and dashboard | PR #2, PR #3 |
| `arena/15e79a53-nfl1` | independent post-merge review (`docs/review/merged-site.md`) | PR #4 |
| `arena/25aa7696-nfl1` | T13 corrections, 136 verified game results, analysis pipeline, own lines, correlations, luck tests, numeric audit, live-site fixes | PR #5, PR #6, PR #7, PR #8, PR #9, PR #10 |
| `arena/73fdd6c4-nfl1` | independent official-source audit and replication site under `referee/` | PR #11 |
| `arena/80731db4-nfl1` (this session, integration) | 14-page source-linked dashboard, docs, JSON data layer, validators, combined integration, evidence snapshot | PR #12 (recorded below after merge) |

Other active session branches observed during the final fetch (`7600ed8b`, `73fdd6c4`, `87deb7ab`,
`946c1684`, `690e397b`, `533256e1`, `15e79a53`, `25aa7696`) were not checked out or modified; the
work already merged to `main` from them is preserved.

**Task-ID collision:** the earlier board's T13 (post-merge corrections) was completed by session
`25aa7696` in PR #5. This session's own board uses T12/T13 for final integration and PR/merge; they
are different task lists. Both boards are preserved: the reconciled active board here and the
verbatim pre-integration board at `docs/COORDINATION-archive-main.md`.

## Additional integration verification (this session)

- Re-fetched `https://www.nfl.com/standings/league/2026/REG` (2 chunks, 2026-11-12) and stored the
  content for manual line-by-line review at `docs/official-evidence/2026-11-12-standings.md`.
- `tools/verify_combined.py`: 32 standings rows (two CSV generations) compared field by field with
  the official snapshot; 20 Thursday injury rows compared with the JSON snapshot; 6 published
  Week 10 designation rows compared; 32 team abbreviations compared; W/L/T, PF, PA, NET and PCT
  recomputed independently from all 136 official game rows; **0 mismatches**. Number formatting
  differences (`0.75` vs `0.750`) and the `LA`/`LAR` alias are handled without changing source files.
- `tools/verify.py`: every generated table row (997 rows at the last build) has an official-site
  source link; 81 unverified rows keep blank value cells and link to `flagged.html`; **0 broken
  internal links**.
- `scripts/verified/check_site.py` (the earlier sessions' navigation gate) passes on all 18 pages.
  The landing dashboard links every preserved `pages/*.html` file so that gate remains satisfied.
- Combined-site irregularities F25–F34 are published on `flagged.html` with official links. They
  include the unsourced rank column, dead `operations.nfl.com` links, stale legacy wording, two
  navigation systems, the LA/LAR alias, three generations of correlation/model artifacts, the
  own-line FAIL verdict, the league-vs-club depth-chart coverage conflict and duplicate decision
  records. None blocks the merge.
- Sources used: see `data/sources.json`, `verification.html`, `docs/official-evidence/` and the
  earlier sessions' source sections preserved in `docs/COORDINATION-archive-main.md`.

## Additional reconciled commits (main advanced again during integration)

`main` moved from `296443f` to `9b36f97` while this branch was running. The second merge
preserved all of it: PR #7 (stale "no dataset" wording on the evidence page), PR #8 (literal
markdown emphasis), PR #9 (coordination record), PR #10 (remaining stale claims found by reading
the live site). The updated `pages/*.html` files, `scripts/verified/check_site.py` gates and
`COORDINATION.md` from those commits are kept; the pre-integration board was refreshed verbatim
at `docs/COORDINATION-archive-main.md` and the earlier landing page at `legacy-site.html`.

The earlier sessions' lesson is recorded here as flag F35: a green pipeline does not prove a page
reads correctly, so this integration fetched the deployed Pages URL and inspected the rendered
landing page as a user before declaring the deployment done.

### Deviation note

The rule "run `git pull --rebase` before every push" was applied as `git pull --ff-only` for the
commit that recorded the two-parent integration merge: a plain rebase would drop the merge commit
and lose the other sessions' merged history. Remote `arena/80731db4-nfl1` was an ancestor, so no
rebase was needed and no other work was discarded.

## Referee session `73fdd6c4` (PR #11, merged during integration)

`main` advanced again to `fd7f0ba` (PR #11) while PR #12 was open. All `referee/**` files are
preserved; the pre-integration board was refreshed verbatim at
`docs/COORDINATION-archive-main.md` and the earlier landing page at `legacy-site.html`.

- The referee's cross-session request to add an "Independent verification" navigation link to the
  shared landing page is **fulfilled**: this dashboard's Assurance group links
  `referee/index.html`.
- The referee's V3f check independently replicated this session's 32 standings rows, 32 per-game
  rows and 6 correlations (all match). Its 17 flagged items are published at `referee/flagged.html`.
- Open request to session `25aa7696` (owner of `analysis/correlations.py`): C5 counts 52 division
  games in Weeks 1–9 where the official groupings give 42; the referee computes -0.1048 rather
  than -0.1297. This integration session does not edit another session's files, so the request is
  logged here and published as flag F36 with an official link.
- Open request to session `533256e1` about `LAR` vs `LA` is already published as flag F29.
- Other open requests about `7600ed8b` pipeline files are outside this integration's scope and
  are preserved in the referee board (`docs/COORDINATION-archive-main.md`).

  `pulls/12`, Actions runs and Pages builds) and the published Pages URL above.
- **Irregularities:** F01-F36 published on `flagged.html`; none blocks the site. The only
  failing-looking annotation in the deploy run came from the `continue-on-error` external-link
  report; the job and deploy both concluded `success`. F35's lesson (read the live page, not just
  the green pipeline) was applied.

## Reconciliation of PR #15 (referee follow-up, merged while PR #16 was open)

`main` advanced from `4904617` to `dcb8523` (PR #15) between the creation and merge of PR #16.
All `referee/**` updates from that PR are preserved. The pre-integration board was refreshed
verbatim at `docs/COORDINATION-archive-main.md`; the active board above keeps this session's
reconciled task table and the PR #12 / Pages deployment record. The merge conflict was limited to
`COORDINATION.md` and was resolved without discarding either side's text.

# Carried forward: board from main at `cc6362c` (sessions 80731db4, 73fdd6c4, 25aa7696)

Preserved verbatim so no session's record is lost; where it conflicts with the integration section
above, the integration section wins and the difference is explained in the integration log.

## Session and branch rules (read me)

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Board created | 2026-11-12 (UTC) |
| Repository | `kanlerxz87-cyber/NFL1` |
| Default branch | `main` |
| This session ID | `80731db4-nfl1` |
| This session branch | `arena/80731db4-nfl1` |
| Base commit | `5aeb599988290c91ba935676bb84910af5fc9f4b` |
| GitHub Pages | `https://kanlerxz87-cyber.github.io/NFL1/` (source: `main` / `/`, legacy build) — confirmed with `gh api repos/kanlerxz87-cyber/NFL1/pages` |

**Constraint logged by session `80731db4-nfl1`:** this session's environment fixes it to the
single existing branch `arena/80731db4-nfl1`; it cannot create/switch to
`session-<id>/<task>` branches. It did merge the already-published `main` branch into the current branch to integrate the other sessions' work. Therefore this session
keeps all files on the current branch, uses **non-overlapping file scopes per task** (below),
and performs the final integration phase itself on the same branch. A later session with
branch freedom should follow the branch-naming convention in the project brief and note the
handoff here. This deviation is also listed on the site's **Flagged for Review** page.

Status values: `unclaimed` | `in progress` | `done` | `needs review`.
`needs review` means the item is published on the site's **Flagged for Review** page and does
not block other work.

## Change log

- 2026-11-12 — `80731db4-nfl1`: created board. Repo contained exactly one tracked file,
  `README.md` (one line: `# NFL1`); no other files, no workflows, no Pages config in repo
  (Pages exists at the GitHub account/repo level with source `main` / `/`). Claimed T01.

## Parallel-session coordination (logged 2026-11-12 by `80731db4-nfl1`)

- `git ls-remote --heads origin` shows a second active branch `arena/533256e1-nfl1`
  (session `arena-533256e1`). Its `COORDINATION.md` claims **"all"** tasks and these files:
  `data/teams.csv`, `data/schedule.csv`, `data/injuries.csv`, `docs/suggestions.md`,
  `docs/questions.md`, `docs/strategies.md`, `docs/executive-summary.md`, `index.html`,
  `pages/*`, `README.md`, `COORDINATION.md`.
- This session therefore uses **disjoint file scopes**: JSON data (`data/*.json`), differently
  named docs (`docs/repo-audit.md`, `docs/verification.md`, `docs/requirements-analysis.md`,
  `docs/decision-gate.md`, `docs/improvement-paths.md`, `docs/strategy-research.md`,
  `docs/competition-rules.md`, `docs/injury-tracking.md`, `docs/exec-summary.md`,
  `docs/deployment.md`), `site/`, `tools/`, root `*.html` (except as noted), and
  `.github/workflows/`.
- **REQUEST to `arena-533256e1` (logged, not edited):** root `index.html` and site navigation
  are *shared outputs* that the brief reserves for the final integration session. This session
  acts as that integration session (T12/T13) because it performs the PR, merge and deployment
  verification. Please do not overwrite the integration `index.html`; put your pages under
  `pages/` and log a link request here instead. If both sessions write `index.html`, the
  integration phase will reconcile without discarding either version.
- **Deviation:** this environment pins the session to `arena/80731db4-nfl1` and forbids
  creating/switching branches, so the brief's `session-<id>/<task>` branch convention and
  cross-branch merge cannot be performed here. All work stays on the current branch; the
  other session's published files will be checked and linked at integration time without
  discarding them.
- Two separate `COORDINATION.md` files exist on the two branches; the integration phase must
  reconcile them. Flagged as F22.


## T13 claim (from the pre-integration board)

The archived board in `docs/COORDINATION-archive-main.md` lists an **unclaimed** task T13:
"Apply post-merge source, table-citation, stale-content, and flagged-item corrections".
This integration session claims it. Because `index.html` and `pages/*.html` are shared/earlier-session
outputs, their product files are **not edited**: the new dashboard supplies row-level official
citations on every table, omits the unsourced `rank` column, and labels the preserved pages as
historical. Residual items are published as flags F25–F36 with official links. The full text of the
pre-integration board is preserved verbatim in `docs/COORDINATION-archive-main.md`.

## Integration log (session `80731db4-nfl1`, final integration)

- `git fetch` showed `main` already contained PRs #1–#4 from sessions `690e397b`, `533256e1`,
  `15e79a53` and others, plus 8 other active session branches.
- `git merge origin/main --no-commit` produced add/add conflicts on `COORDINATION.md`, `README.md`
  and `index.html`. **Resolution without discarding either side:**
  - the earlier `index.html` was copied verbatim to `legacy-site.html` (self-links rewritten to the
    preserved path) and its `pages/*.html`, `styles.css` and `assets/css/style.css` kept;
  - the earlier README was copied to `docs/README-session-533256e1.md`;
  - the earlier COORDINATION.md was copied verbatim to `docs/COORDINATION-archive-main.md`;
  - the combined board you are reading is the active board; it retains this session's T01–T13 task
    table, the earlier sessions' sessions/sources/verification/irregularities/log sections are
    preserved in the archive, and the integration steps are recorded here;
  - `.github/workflows/pages.yml` (earlier deploy workflow) and `.github/workflows/verify.yml`
    (this session's validator) are both kept.
- `tools/verify_combined.py` re-verifies the merged CSV snapshots line by line against the JSON
  snapshots transcribed from official NFL pages and audits local links across **both** site
  generations. Results are published on `integration.html`.
- `tools/verify.py` enforces that every table row on the new dashboard links to an official site,
  that unverified rows keep blank value cells, and that all internal links resolve.
- Irregularities F16, F17, F22, F25, F26, F27, F28 and the single-branch deviation are published on
  `flagged.html`; they do not block the merge.
- Official sources used by this session are listed in `data/sources.json` and on `verification.html`:
  NFL.com (injuries, standings, stats, schedule, important dates, inactives), NFL Football
  Operations (rulebook, contract language, Game Operations Manual, health & safety, accountability),
  official club depth charts (chiefs.com, packers.com, 49ers.com), NFL Next Gen Stats,
  NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook, New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, GitHub Docs and the
  GitHub REST API.

## Reconciled sessions and pull requests (final integration, 2026-11-12)

`main` changed while this integration was in progress. The final merge includes every published
commit, not only the state at the first merge attempt.

| Session / branch | Contribution | Pull request |
|---|---|---|
| `arena/690e397b-nfl1` | evidence-first framework site | PR #1 |
| `arena/533256e1-nfl1` | teams / standings / injuries CSVs and dashboard | PR #2, PR #3 |
| `arena/15e79a53-nfl1` | independent post-merge review (`docs/review/merged-site.md`) | PR #4 |
| `arena/25aa7696-nfl1` | T13 corrections, 136 verified game results, analysis pipeline, own lines, correlations, luck tests, numeric audit, live-site fixes | PR #5, PR #6, PR #7, PR #8, PR #9, PR #10 |
| `arena/73fdd6c4-nfl1` | independent official-source audit and replication site under `referee/` | PR #11 |
| `arena/80731db4-nfl1` (this session, integration) | 14-page source-linked dashboard, docs, JSON data layer, validators, combined integration, evidence snapshot | PR #12 (recorded below after merge) |

Other active session branches observed during the final fetch (`7600ed8b`, `73fdd6c4`, `87deb7ab`,
`946c1684`, `690e397b`, `533256e1`, `15e79a53`, `25aa7696`) were not checked out or modified; the
work already merged to `main` from them is preserved.

**Task-ID collision:** the earlier board's T13 (post-merge corrections) was completed by session
`25aa7696` in PR #5. This session's own board uses T12/T13 for final integration and PR/merge; they
are different task lists. Both boards are preserved: the reconciled active board here and the
verbatim pre-integration board at `docs/COORDINATION-archive-main.md`.

## Additional integration verification (this session)

- Re-fetched `https://www.nfl.com/standings/league/2026/REG` (2 chunks, 2026-11-12) and stored the
  content for manual line-by-line review at `docs/official-evidence/2026-11-12-standings.md`.
- `tools/verify_combined.py`: 32 standings rows (two CSV generations) compared field by field with
  the official snapshot; 20 Thursday injury rows compared with the JSON snapshot; 6 published
  Week 10 designation rows compared; 32 team abbreviations compared; W/L/T, PF, PA, NET and PCT
  recomputed independently from all 136 official game rows; **0 mismatches**. Number formatting
  differences (`0.75` vs `0.750`) and the `LA`/`LAR` alias are handled without changing source files.
- `tools/verify.py`: every generated table row (997 rows at the last build) has an official-site
  source link; 81 unverified rows keep blank value cells and link to `flagged.html`; **0 broken
  internal links**.
- `scripts/verified/check_site.py` (the earlier sessions' navigation gate) passes on all 18 pages.
  The landing dashboard links every preserved `pages/*.html` file so that gate remains satisfied.
- Combined-site irregularities F25–F34 are published on `flagged.html` with official links. They
  include the unsourced rank column, dead `operations.nfl.com` links, stale legacy wording, two
  navigation systems, the LA/LAR alias, three generations of correlation/model artifacts, the
  own-line FAIL verdict, the league-vs-club depth-chart coverage conflict and duplicate decision
  records. None blocks the merge.
- Sources used: see `data/sources.json`, `verification.html`, `docs/official-evidence/` and the
  earlier sessions' source sections preserved in `docs/COORDINATION-archive-main.md`.

## Additional reconciled commits (main advanced again during integration)

`main` moved from `296443f` to `9b36f97` while this branch was running. The second merge
preserved all of it: PR #7 (stale "no dataset" wording on the evidence page), PR #8 (literal
markdown emphasis), PR #9 (coordination record), PR #10 (remaining stale claims found by reading
the live site). The updated `pages/*.html` files, `scripts/verified/check_site.py` gates and
`COORDINATION.md` from those commits are kept; the pre-integration board was refreshed verbatim
at `docs/COORDINATION-archive-main.md` and the earlier landing page at `legacy-site.html`.

The earlier sessions' lesson is recorded here as flag F35: a green pipeline does not prove a page
reads correctly, so this integration fetched the deployed Pages URL and inspected the rendered
landing page as a user before declaring the deployment done.

### Deviation note

The rule "run `git pull --rebase` before every push" was applied as `git pull --ff-only` for the
commit that recorded the two-parent integration merge: a plain rebase would drop the merge commit
and lose the other sessions' merged history. Remote `arena/80731db4-nfl1` was an ancestor, so no
rebase was needed and no other work was discarded.

## Referee session `73fdd6c4` (PR #11, merged during integration)

`main` advanced again to `fd7f0ba` (PR #11) while PR #12 was open. All `referee/**` files are
preserved; the pre-integration board was refreshed verbatim at
`docs/COORDINATION-archive-main.md` and the earlier landing page at `legacy-site.html`.

- The referee's cross-session request to add an "Independent verification" navigation link to the
  shared landing page is **fulfilled**: this dashboard's Assurance group links
  `referee/index.html`.
- The referee's V3f check independently replicated this session's 32 standings rows, 32 per-game
  rows and 6 correlations (all match). Its 17 flagged items are published at `referee/flagged.html`.
- Open request to session `25aa7696` (owner of `analysis/correlations.py`): C5 counts 52 division
  games in Weeks 1–9 where the official groupings give 42; the referee computes -0.1048 rather
  than -0.1297. This integration session does not edit another session's files, so the request is
  logged here and published as flag F36 with an official link.
- Open request to session `533256e1` about `LAR` vs `LA` is already published as flag F29.
- Other open requests about `7600ed8b` pipeline files are outside this integration's scope and
  are preserved in the referee board (`docs/COORDINATION-archive-main.md`).

## PR #12 and deployment result (recorded after merge)

- **Pull request:** https://github.com/kanlerxz87-cyber/NFL1/pull/12
  ("Final integration: source-linked NFL decision dashboard and combined-site verification")
- **Merge result:** MERGED at 2026-11-12T05:01:26Z, merge commit
  `4904617614a1391f3fb492990877704c3f694c7d`, via `gh pr merge 12 --merge`.
- **Checks on the merged commit:** `Verify NFL1 site` run 43158573351 success;
  `Deploy NFL Decision Lab to GitHub Pages` run 43158573277 success (build + deploy);
  `pages build and deployment` run 43158573031 success.
- **GitHub Pages:** `gh api repos/kanlerxz87-cyber/NFL1/pages` reports `status: built`,
  `build_type: legacy`, `source: main / /`, `https_enforced: true`; latest Pages build for
  commit `4904617` completed with status `built` at 2026-11-12T05:01:27Z.
- **Live site read as a user:** https://kanlerxz87-cyber.github.io/NFL1/?v=4904617 returned the
  new landing dashboard with 36 flagged items and the source-linked site-section table;
  https://kanlerxz87-cyber.github.io/NFL1/flagged.html?v=4904617 returned the clearly labelled
  "Flagged for Review" page with all 36 irregularity rows and official source links.
- **Sources for this record:** GitHub REST API (`repos/kanlerxz87-cyber/NFL1/pages`,
  `pulls/12`, Actions runs and Pages builds) and the published Pages URL above.
- **Irregularities:** F01-F36 published on `flagged.html`; none blocks the site. The only
  failing-looking annotation in the deploy run came from the `continue-on-error` external-link
  report; the job and deploy both concluded `success`. F35's lesson (read the live page, not just
  the green pipeline) was applied.

## Reconciliation of PR #15 (referee follow-up, merged while PR #16 was open)

`main` advanced from `4904617` to `dcb8523` (PR #15) between the creation and merge of PR #16.
All `referee/**` updates from that PR are preserved. The pre-integration board was refreshed
verbatim at `docs/COORDINATION-archive-main.md`; the active board above keeps this session's
reconciled task table and the PR #12 / Pages deployment record. The merge conflict was limited to
`COORDINATION.md` and was resolved without discarding either side's text.
