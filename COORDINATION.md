Sessions that have worked here:

| Session | Branch | Contribution | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `690e397b-nfl1` | `arena/690e397b-nfl1` | Framework site, evidence register, flagged page (PR #1) | merged |
| `533256e1-nfl1` | `arena/533256e1-nfl1` | Data tables (teams, standings, injuries CSV) + dashboard (PR #2, #3) | merged |
| `80731db4-nfl1` | `arena/80731db4-nfl1` | Task board scaffold | not merged (superseded) |
| `946c1684-nfl1` | `arena/946c1684-nfl1` | League reference data, environment notes (curl allow-list; `fetch_page` has full internet) | not merged (superseded) |
| `7600ed8b-nfl1` | `arena/7600ed8b-nfl1` | Quantitative pipeline, own lines, strategy gates, injury/depth model, props, verification, final integration | PR #13 |

> Branch naming: Arena fixes each session to a single branch named `arena/<session>-nfl1`, so the
> `session-<id>/<task>` convention in the brief cannot be followed here. Scopes were kept
> non-overlapping by file instead, and this board records them.

## Sources used (all verified reachable during the build)

- Standings (verification fixture): <https://www.nfl.com/standings/league/2026/reg>
- Official injury report (scraped weekly): <https://www.nfl.com/injuries/>
- Schedules: <https://www.nfl.com/schedules/>
- Player stats: <https://www.nfl.com/stats/player-stats/>
- Club directory: <https://www.nfl.com/teams/>
- NFL Football Operations: <https://operations.nfl.com/gameday/>
- Data mirror (CC-BY-4.0): <https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data> — releases `schedules`,
  `injuries`, `depth_charts`, `weekly_rosters`, `snap_counts`, `stats_player`, `pbp`, `players`,
  `teams`

## Verification performed

1. **Standings** — computed from game results and compared with 32 rows hand-transcribed from
   nfl.com: 32/32 match.
2. **Official injury scrape** — compared with 44 hand-transcribed nfl.com rows: 44/44 match
   (position, injury, practice status, game status).
3. **Mirrored feed coverage** — 20 of 254 official week-10 rows exist in the mirror: published as
   irregularity V3, and the reason the site scrapes the official page directly.
4. **Companion transcription cross-check** — computed standings vs `data/standings.csv`: 32/32;
   scrape vs `data/injuries.csv`: 20/20 (after mapping nfl.com club codes AZ→ARI, LAR→LA).
5. **Line-sign convention** — proved from data, not assumed: correlation between the mirrored
   closing line and the home margin is 0.439 over 5,591 games.
6. **Site** — every internal link checked before commit; every table row carries a source link;
   blank values are labelled `blank`, never inferred.

## Irregularities (published on the Flagged for Review page)

- **V3 / F01** Mirrored injury feed is incomplete in-season (20 of 254 rows). Mitigated by scraping
  nfl.com directly; still a risk if the scrape fails.
- **F11** Four clubs (BAL, CIN, LAC, SEA) had no published report at scrape time; their rows are
  zero because the report is absent, not because the club is healthy.
- **F12** Practice-only weights (DNP 0.5, limited 0.2) are a modelling assumption, not a league rule.
- **F02** No official or book-level odds exist; closing lines are consensus numbers from the mirror.
- **F04** Prop prices absent, so prop and combo edges cannot be computed; market columns are blank.
- **F05** Rewards with monetary value need legal review; the leaderboard is paper points only.
- **F06/F09/F10** Model history limited to 2024-2026; weather, travel and inactives not ingested.
- **F07** The line-sign convention was initially inverted in this build and corrected after the
  correlation check; recorded so a reviewer can challenge the fix.

## Integration log

- `arena/7600ed8b-nfl1` branched from `5aeb599`, rebased onto `c755a45`, then merged `origin/main`
  at `9c5ee13` (sessions `690e397b` and `533256e1` already merged).
- Merge conflicts (COORDINATION.md, README.md, index.html, pages/injuries.html, pages/questions.html,
  pages/strategies.html, pages/suggestions.html) were resolved in favour of the regenerated
  integration pages. **Nothing from the other sessions was discarded**: their data
  (`data/teams.csv`, `data/standings.csv`, `data/injuries.csv`) is kept, cross-checked in the
  verification stage, and their pages (`pages/teams.html`, `pages/standings.html`,
  `pages/executive-summary.html`, `pages/flagged.html`) remain live and are linked from the
  Evidence page.
- `pages/models.html` is kept as a redirect to `pages/lines.html` so older links do not break.
- Automated refresh: `.github/workflows/collect-data.yml` runs on pushes touching `pipeline/` and
  daily at 11:17 UTC; it re-downloads, re-verifies and commits `data/model/*.json`.
- **PR and merge record:** see the "PR" section below (filled after merge).

## PR / merge

- Pull request: [#13](https://github.com/kanlerxz87-cyber/NFL1/pull/13) — `arena/7600ed8b-nfl1` → `main`.
- Merge result and Pages deployment: recorded in the log entry appended after the merge.
